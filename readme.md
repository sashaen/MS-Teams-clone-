# Video calling-chat web application
- Hi everyone! 
- I created this video calling-chat web application for MS ENGAGE Program 2021. The website is fully functional and useable in real life. This is handy and easy to use. This lets a group of people to talk , chat and share any information together. This is functioned like this so that no two different meeting will clash by same name. Every time a unique ID will be created to enter room for video call and chat. 
I used agile methodaology for this project as mentioned as part of this program. I divided my whole task into 4 weeks. I started completing my tasks as sprint wise that helped in smooth learing and building the product.
